/**
 * <p>The <b>main class</b> of a simple simulator for TCP congestion
 * control.<BR> Check also the
 * <a href="http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~marsic/books/CN/projects/tcp/" target="_top">design
 * documentation for this simulator</a>.
 * <BR>The simulator provides the system clock ticks for time
 * progression and orchestrates the work of the network nodes.
 * The simulated network consists of the network elements of sender-host,
 * router, and receiver-host, connected in a chain as follows:
 * <pre>
 * <center> SENDER <-> NETWORK/ROUTER <-> RECEIVER </center>
 * </pre>
 * The sender host sends only data segments and the receiver host
 * only replies with acknowledgments.  In other words, for simplicity
 * we assume <i>unidirectional transmission</i>.</p>
 * 
 * <p>By default, the simulator reports the values of the congestion
 * control parameters for every iteration:
 * <ol>
 * <li> Iteration number (starting value 1), which is also the simulation
 * clock, in the units of round-trip times (RTTs)</li>
 * <li> Congestion window size in this iteration</li>
 * <li> Effective window size in this iteration</li>
 * <li> Flight size (the number of unacknowledged bytes) in this iteration</li>
 * <li> Slow start threshold size in this iteration</li>
 * </ol>
 * At the end of the simulation, the <i>utilization of the sender</i>
 * is reported.</p>
 * 
 * <p>You can turn ON or OFF different levels of reporting by modifying
 * the variable {@link #currentReportingLevel}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Only a few parameters can be controlled in this simulator.
 * Rather than have a flexible, multifunctional network simulator
 * that takes long time to understand and use,
 * this simulator is simple for an undergraduate student
 * to understand and use during a semester-long course.
 * The students can modify it with modest effort and study several
 * interesting simulation scenarios described in the
 * <a href="http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~marsic/books/CN/projects/tcp/" target="_top">design documentation</a>.</p>
