/**
 * TCP Tahoe implementation of a sender.
 * <P>
 * <b>Note</b>: This implementation is based on
 * <a href="http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1122.html" target="page">RFC 1122 &ndash;
 * Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication Layers</a>,
 * published in 1989, which I believe specified TCP Tahoe.
 * See <a href="http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1122.html#sec-4.2" target="page">Section
 * 4.2</a> of RFC&nbsp;1122. <BR>
 * TCP Tahoe was superseded by TCP Reno, specified in
 * <a href="http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2001.html" target="page">RFC 2001</a>
 * and <a href="http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2581.html" target="page">RFC 2581</a>.
 * The current version (&ldquo;TCP NewReno&rdquo;) is specified in
 * <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5681" target="page">RFC 5681</a>.
 * <BR><i>Do not rely on any textbooks for precise details!</i>
 * <BR> Read the textbook(s) for high-level understanding of
 * the material; read the RFCs for precise details.
