	 * TCP Reno in Section 3.2 Fast Retransmit/Fast Recovery
	 * in Step 5 says:
	 * &ldquo;<i>When the next ACK arrives that acknowledges new data,
	 * ... this ACK should acknowledge all the intermediate
     * segments sent between the lost segment and the receipt of the
     * third duplicate ACK, if none of these were lost.</i>&rdquo;<BR>
     * But, it does't say what if this is not true.</P>
	 * 
	 * <P>The answer is that the <i>old</i> Reno simply exits
	 * fast recovery when it receives an ACK for previously
	 * unacknowledged data (known as a "recovery ACK"), and that is what
	 * <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2581" target="page">RFC 2581</a>
	 * says about processing new ACKs during Fast Recovery.</p>
     * 
	 * <P>Unlike this, TCP <b>NewReno</b> sender
	 * distinguishes "partial acknowledgments"
	 * as defined in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3782" target="page">RFC 3782</a>
	 * (ACKs that cover previously unacknowledged data, but
	 * not all the data outstanding when loss was detected). The sender
	 * remains in Fast Recovery until a new ACK acknowledges <i>all</i>
	 * the data outstanding at the time when {@link Sender#dupACKthreshold}
	 * dupACKs were received.<BR>
	 * Only when the NewReno sender receives a "full ACK",
	 * it behaves the same as old Reno, and exits Fast Recovery.<BR>
	 * Whether the new ACK is "partial" or "full" is determined
	 * by comparing it to the parameter
	 * {@link Sender#lastByteSentBefore3xDupAcksRecvd}.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5681" target="page">RFC 5681</a>
	 * (in Section 3.2) states that the retransmit timer should be reset
	 * only for the <em>first partial ACK</em> that arrives during fast recovery
	 * (applies only to TCP NewReno).
	 * Timer management in <b>NewReno</b> is discussed in more detail in Section 4 of RFC 5681.<br />
	 * Our simplified implementation resets the RTO timer for every partial ACK. </p>
