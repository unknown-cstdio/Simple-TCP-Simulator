 * and <a href="http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2581.html" target="page">RFC 2581</a>
 * as closely as I could. However, some intricate details are left out.
 * In particular, because this is a simple discrete-time simulator
 * and the clock tick granularity is very coarse (one tick equals
 * one round-trip time (RTT)), the delayed-ACKs timer is not
 * implemented as recommended. See more discussion related to
 * {@link #delayedACKtimer} and {@link #cumulativeACK}.

	 * an ACK for each incoming data segment (including in-order segments).
	 * <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122" target="page">RFC 1122</a> states
	 * that hosts should use "delayed acknowledgments" for in-order segments.
	 * Using this approach, an ACK is generated for at least every second in-order,
	 * full-sized segment, or if a second full-sized segment does not arrive
	 * within a given timeout (which must not exceed 500 ms [RFC 1122],  and
	 * is typically less than 200 ms).
	 * Such approach is also adopted in
	 * <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2581" target="page">RFC 2581</a>.
	 * <BR><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2760" target="page">RFC 2760</a>
	 * also allows to generate <em>Stretch ACKs</em> that acknowledge more
	 * than two in-order full-sized segments. This approach
	 * provides a possible mitigation, which reduces the rate at which ACKs
	 * are returned by the receiver. The interested reader should check for
	 * discussion of modified delayed ACKs in
	 * <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3449" target="page">RFC 3449</a>
