 * The <b>NewReno</b> version of the TCP sender was described in

 * and clarified in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3782" target="page">RFC 3782</a>.<BR>
 * This is a highly simplified version of NewReno sender,
 * which is currently specified in
 * <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5681" target="page">RFC 5681</a>.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This class does not implement any code. It just serves
 * to help the {@link SenderStateFastRecovery} to know in
 * which context it is running (old Reno or NewReno) and to
 * behave accordingly.
