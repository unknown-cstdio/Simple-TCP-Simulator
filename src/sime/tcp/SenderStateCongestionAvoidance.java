 * that are not implemented here. For example,
 * it is recommended that the sender increments its
 * congestion window by one MSS per RTT, unless
 * the receiver acknowledged less than one MSS
 * during this period. This is to avoid security attacks
 * by so-called "ACK Division".
 * The reader should check the details in

	 * 
	 * <p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5681" target="page">RFC 5681</a>
	 * says that during congestion avoidance, TCP sender must not
	 * increase its congestion window by more than MSS bytes per round-trip time (RTT).<p>
	 * 
	 * <p>RFC 5681 describes several ways of how this can be achieved.
	 * The recommended way to increase CongWin during congestion avoidance is
	 * to count the number of bytes that have been acknowledged by ACKs for
	 * new data. When the number of bytes acknowledged reaches CongWin,
	 * then CongWin can be incremented by up to MSS bytes.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Another common method is to use the formula:
	 * <pre>
	 * CongWin += MSS*MSS/CongWin
	 * </pre>
	 * Note that for a connection where the receiver sends cumulative
	 * ACKs, this formula will lead to increasing CongWin by less
	 * than 1 full-sized segment per RTT.<p>
