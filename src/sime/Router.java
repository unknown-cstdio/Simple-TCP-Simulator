/**
 * This class is a simple simulation of a network router. It is
 * expressly crafted to "route" TCP packets.  What it does it to
 * enforce that no more packets are let pass through than what the
 * <i>bottleneck resource capacity</i> allows.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The bottleneck resource that we study using this router is the
 * memory space, which determines the maximum possible queue length
 * (the queuing capacity).
 * If more packets arrive than the queue (buffer) can hold,
 * the excess packets are discarded.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The router needs help from the simulator environment to
 * know about the progression of time. The simulation clock ticking
 * is signaled by invocation of the method {@link #send(NetworkElement, Packet)}.
 * Every time this method is called, the router performs
 * the work allowed within the elapsed time.
 * Currently, this means that the router will hand over the queued
 * packets in {@link #packetBuffer} to their outgoing links ({@link #outputPorts}).</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note that this class defines an inner class for output ports
 * (see {@link sime.Router.OutputPort}).</p>
